Two projects for a CFPB skills assessment due April 7, 2023 at 12pm Eastern.

1. hhbuilder - capture and display a household's individual members using a simple web form

2. noclist - create a CLI program that can pull a VIP user list from an unreliable API and print the results to stdout

TODO: RESEARCH: want to use python and JS since that's their stack?

TODO: gifs of projects

## Dev Environment Setup

TODO: individual project descriptions with links to specific documentation per project

## Testing

TODO: list tooling used and test commands

## Future Improvements

TODO: will I need this for the general readme?

Thank you for considering me for this position, and I hope to hear more from the CFPB soon.
