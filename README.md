Two projects for a CFPB skills assessment due April 7, 2023 at 12pm Eastern.

1. hhbuilder (JS/HTML) - capture and display a household's individual members using a simple web form

2. noclist (Python) - create a CLI program that can pull a VIP user list from an unreliable API and print the results to stdout

To be a good fit for the CFPB tech stack, I've chosen to use JavaScript and Python.

TODO: want to use python and JS since that's your stack

TODO: gifs of projects

## Dev Environment Setup

TODO: individual project descriptions with links to specific documentation per project

## Testing

TODO: list tooling used and test commands

TODO: most controversial: not a pure JS solution, they said I could change dom, all the screen readers
handle that stuff differently 

TODO: es6, email comments

TODO: more time? would consider putting them into objects and classes


TODO: said put code HERE... which made me sad

## Future Improvements

TODO: will I need this for the general readme?

Thank you for considering me for this position, and I hope to hear more from the CFPB soon.
