- pains me not to use CSS, but it says not to make it pretty
- only one file for JS?
- it's going to be fun to do old JS
- important for me to use HTML validation to complete for accessibility
- allow submitting with unadded houshold members?
- I prefer to use slightly longer, but very explicit variable names, but flexible
- capitalize relations and states when rendered?
- Can ages have decimals?
- assume backend validation
- display server errors
- video of project with screen reader
- tests on chrome, firefox, safari - latest stable versions

TODO: brief description
TODO: gif of project
## Dev Environment
- node v19.8.1

// The following code is based on the restriction from the assessment challenge that the index.js
// file cannot be changed in any way while also following industry standard accessibility practices.
// Accessibility best practices are to use HTML's built-in form validation as much as possible in
// order to allow the widest range of screen readers to report input restrictions (see screen reader
// demo in the README)

- keep server the source of truth
- would be great to have a declarative framework
- I hate that I can't mess with the index.html at all, and I'm guessing messing with it with babel to import them as modules would be bad
- keep all code in index.js?

## Testing

TODO: test on all the browsers

## Future Improvements
- can't change index.js, bad accessibility
  - add ids for JS
  - required and minimums
  - whole number ages?
  - it'd be great to add a unique ID for each of these users, but I'll leave that to the future backend
  - assume backend validation
  - index.js said put your code here, so I wasn't sure if I could use modules, which I might depending on the conventions where I worked
  - store
  -   // Would prefer to use FormData API for extensibility here if without restrictions, see README.md
  -       <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
  - code goes here
