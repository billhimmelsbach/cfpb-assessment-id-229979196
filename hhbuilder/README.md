TODO: brainstorming

- pains me not to use CSS, but it says not to make it pretty
- only one file for JS?
- it's going to be fun to do old JS
- important for me to use HTML validation to complete for accessibility
- allow submitting with unadded household members?
- I prefer to use slightly longer, but very explicit variable names, but flexible
- capitalize relations and states when rendered?
- can ages have decimals?
- assume backend validation
- display server errors
- video of project with screen reader
- tests on chrome, firefox, safari - latest stable versions

TODO: brief description
TODO: gif of project
## Dev Environment
- node v19.8.1

## Testing

TODO: test on all the browsers

## Future Improvements
- can't change index.js, bad accessibility
  - add ids for JS
  - required and minimums
  - whole number ages?
  - it'd be great to add a unique ID for each of these users, but I'll leave that to the future backend
  - assume backend validation
  - index.js said put your code here, so I wasn't sure if I could use modules, which I might depending on the conventions where I worked
